**How do I approach designing software?**

I design software by analyzing requirements and dividing them into manageable parts. For this project, I planned my scene based on my physical space, choosing which objects to model and which primitives to use. The shoe stand, couch, lamp, and small table were all mapped out in advance, providing a clear roadmap for the setup. Focusing on structure early let me create a scene that met project goals and followed a logical design process.

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**

This project developed my skill in building complex objects from simple primitives. For instance, the lamp combined cylinders and a hemisphere, making me think in three dimensions. I also improved at using textures. Applying brick, marble, fabric, and wood textures gave each object identity and made the scene more authentic.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**

I followed an iterative process from block-out to refinement. First, I placed basic primitives to check proportions and scale. Once the foundation was set, I refined models and then applied textures and lighting. This step-by-step process provided me with a clear workflow and ensured that I always had a testable scene.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**

You can start with a simple approach and refine it over time in any software project. Instead of aiming for perfection, create a working version and improve it step by step. This approach also applies to courses or professional projects, where you break down complexity to maintain progress.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

When developing programs, I prioritize functionality, then enhance usability and refine the overall experience. For this project, I ensured the camera system functioned properly before adding advanced features like projection switching or refining textures. This process made the core experience reliable before I expanded the features.

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**

Two new strategies I used were camera navigation and projection switching. The navigation system combined keyboard and mouse controls, making the scene more interactive. Switching between perspective and orthographic views gave me a deeper understanding of rendering and user perception of depth.

**How did iteration factor into your development?**

Iteration was central to my process. After every change, whether it was adjusting the camera speed, resizing textures, or modifying lighting, I tested the scene immediately. This allowed me to catch errors quickly and avoid making bigger mistakes later. Iteration gave me confidence. I always knew the state of my project and could measure improvement with each step.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones that led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

At first, my approach focused on getting things to compile and run. As milestones progressed, I became more intentional: adding detailed comments, organizing files, and testing each feature incrementally. By the time I completed the final project, I had considered readability and maintainability, which represented a significant improvement from where I started.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Computer science provides strategies and technical knowledge that support my career path. This project taught me how to break down large problems into smaller, testable steps and helped me develop habits essential for achieving my goal of becoming a database analyst, where accuracy, organization, and systematic thinking are crucial.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**

Computational graphics has given me insight into math, geometry, and transformations, fundamental concepts that extend beyond 3D graphics. I now have experience in designing, modeling, and rendering, providing a foundation for advanced topics such as animation or simulation in future classes.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**

Professionally, these skills will be beneficial in areas such as simulation, visualization, and design. Understanding interactive environments enables me to present complex information in a more engaging manner. Though my focus is on data analysis, visualization skills enhance my work. This project showed how visualization makes raw information comprehensible, a directly applicable skill.
